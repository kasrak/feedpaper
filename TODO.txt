# Prioritized
- filter out retweets if original tweet is in that day's feed
- click to expand media
- animated gifs
- exclude non-english tweets
- collocate related tweets by looking at keywords? https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyword-extractor
- also collocate tweets from same author (in some time window...?)

# Rendering feed
- pull in original tweet for replies, e.g. https://twitter.com/ntkris/status/1641585664654295041?s=20
- dark mode
- fix scroll restoration when going back to list
- fix date issue:
    - should show tweets from yesterday in your timezone, so the default
      "yesterday" view doesn't grow in size throughout the day
    - should be based on ingestion date, not tweet posted date, since "for you"
      can surface old tweets

# Rendering individual tweets
- multi-image http://localhost:3000/tweet/1640585475944505345 http://localhost:3000/tweet/1641852901713915904
- "Show more" for note_tweets

# Generating digest
