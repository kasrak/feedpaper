- bug: "round-up" tweet threads end up causing it to over-merge conversations. e.g.
    - a = tweet about product A launching
    - b = tweet about product B launching
    - [c, d] = a thread that links to a & b respectively
    - in this case, we don't want all of [a, b, c, d] to be in one conversation.
      there are actually two separate conversations (a, c), (b, d)...
- remember scroll position per day
- don't pull focus when app runs scraping
- click to expand media
- animated gifs/videos
- "show this thread"?
- open tweets in dedicated twitter tab (and separate from bg fetch twitter tab)
- omit plain retweets if original tweet (or a retweet of it) was in yesterday's digest
- if last link is to quoted/retweeted tweet, remove it from text: http://localhost:3000/tweet/1641563370431164416
- if the tweet is just a link to another tweet, don't show the link in text: http://localhost:3000/tweet/1646368688189186054
- "show more" for note_tweets hides media (extended_entities?): http://localhost:3000/tweet/1641482810266648576
- improve sorting, e.g. http://localhost:3000/?date=2023-04-13 "databricks"
- use GPT to summarize clusters with 3+ tweets
- pull in original tweet for replies & quotes, e.g. https://twitter.com/ntkris/status/1641585664654295041?s=20
