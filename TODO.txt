# Rendering feed
- pull in original tweet for replies, e.g. https://twitter.com/ntkris/status/1641585664654295041?s=20
- dark mode
- colocate replies, self-replies, and quote tweets adjacent to original tweet
- fix scroll restoration when going back to list
- fix date issue:
    - should show tweets from yesterday in your timezone, so the default
      "yesterday" view doesn't grow in size throughout the day
    - should be based on ingestion date, not tweet posted date, since "for you"
      can surface old tweets

# Rendering individual tweets
- limit media size
- animated gifs
- click to expand media
- multi-image http://localhost:3000/tweet/1640585475944505345
