- standalone app
    - run "client" in electron app so there's only 1 thing to launch
    - code clean up: save tweets directly from main process, instead of HTTP POST
    - run enrichment script automatically
    - open tweets in dedicated twitter tab (and separate from bg fetch twitter tab)

- better item rendering
    - click to expand media
    - animated gifs/videos
    - multi-image http://localhost:3000/tweet/1640585475944505345 http://localhost:3000/tweet/1641852901713915904
    - if last link is to quoted/retweeted tweet, remove it from text: http://localhost:3000/tweet/1641563370431164416
    - "show more" for note_tweets hides media (extended_entities?): http://localhost:3000/tweet/1641482810266648576

- better clustering
    - merge related clusters (fix greedy bug)
    - use GPT to summarize clusters with 3+ tweets
    - omit plain retweets if original tweet was in yesterday's digest
    - don't repeat multiple plain retweets
    - pull in original tweet for replies, e.g. https://twitter.com/ntkris/status/1641585664654295041?s=20

- feed experience
    - remember scroll position per day
    - dark mode

    - first: 24-hour tape delay
        - solves fomo, constantly checking. everything will be there tomorrow,
        and there's no incentive to check multiple times per day.
        - but also lets us do better grouping of tweets.
    - better grouping of tweets:
        - first: start with the data that's available: replies, retweets, quotes, urls.
          this creates "conversation" clusters.
        - then use gpt-3-turbo to extract entities, and re-sort the timeline so related
          conversation clusters are next to each other. a much better reading experience,
          because you're not constantly context switching between topics. transitions between
          related topics instead.
    - the 24-hour tape delay also makes it possible to do all this post-processing without
      worrying about LLM speed, which is nice.
    - gpt-4 is better, but too expensive to feed every tweet through... for me that would be
      $60 per month. gpt-3-turbo is ~$3 per month. scales with number of people you follow and
      how much they tweet.
    - ideas for improvement
        - hide low-signal tweets based on your preferences, or rank based on relevance
          to your preferences
        - summarize conversation clusters or larger sections, then decide if you want
          to go in and read all the tweets or not
        - pull in from other sources, e.g. HN, mastodon, etc
        - somehow visualize the topic space so you can "skip ahead" more quickly
